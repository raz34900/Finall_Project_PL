-----------------------------------------
            Language Features
-----------------------------------------

1. **Variable Declaration and Assignment**
   - Variables are declared using the keyword `VAR` followed by an identifier and assignment (`=`).
   - Variables can hold integer values.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - Supports basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).

3. **Comparison Operators**
   - Supports comparisons between integers (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
   - `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` are available for boolean logic.

4. **Control Flow**
   - Conditional expressions: `IF`, `ELIF`, `ELSE`.
   - Evaluates conditions in sequence, executing corresponding blocks based on true conditions.

5. **Functions**
   - Supports user-defined functions using the keyword `FUNC`.
   - Functions can have named arguments.
   - Functions can be called with arguments.
   - Supports recursion.

6. **Unary Operators**
   - Supports unary plus (`+`) and unary minus (`-`) for arithmetic.
   - Logical negation (`NOT`) for boolean expressions.

                BNF Grammar
-----------------------------------------

1. Expression (expr)
Represents expressions, which include assignments or conditional operations.

expr ::= 'VAR' IDENTIFIER '=' expr
       | comp-expr ( ('AND' | 'OR') comp-expr )*


Includes:
    - Variable Assignments: VAR IDENTIFIER = expr
    - Logical Expressions: Logical operations involving AND and OR.

2. Comparison Expression (comp-expr)
Represents comparison expressions, supporting basic arithmetic comparisons and logical NOT.

comp-expr ::= 'NOT' comp-expr
            | arith-expr ( ('==' | '!=' | '<' | '>' | '<=' | '>=') arith-expr )*

Includes:
    - Logical Negation: NOT comp-expr
    - Arithmetic Comparisons: Using ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.

3. Arithmetic Expression (arith-expr)
Represents arithmetic expressions involving addition or subtraction.

arith-expr ::= term ( ('+' | '-') term )*

Includes:
    - Addition and Subtraction: Operations between terms.

4. Term (term)
Represents multiplication, division, and modulo operations between factors.

term ::= factor ( ('*' | '/' | '%') factor )*

Includes:
    - Multiplication, Division, and Modulo: Operations between factors.

5. Function Call (call)
Represents a function call.

call ::= factor ( '(' ( expr (',' expr)* )? ')' )?


Includes:
    - A function followed by optional arguments enclosed in parentheses.
    - Allows zero or more arguments, separated by commas.

6. Factor (factor)
Represents atomic components of expressions.

factor ::= INT
         | IDENTIFIER
         | ( '+' | '-' ) factor
         | '(' expr ')'
         | if-expr
         | func-def


Includes:
    - Atomic Elements: Integers, identifiers (variables).
    - Unary Operations: Unary plus and minus.
    - Parenthesized Expressions: ( expr )
    - Conditional and Function Definitions: if-expr, func-def.

7. Conditional Expression (if-expr)
Represents conditional (if-elif-else) expressions.

if-expr ::= 'IF' expr 'THEN' expr
          | ('ELIF' expr 'THEN' expr )*
          | ('ELSE' expr )?

Includes:
    - IF Block: Followed by optional ELIF and ELSE blocks.
    - Execution Sequence: Conditions are evaluated in sequence, and the corresponding expression is executed.

8. Function Definition (func-def)
Represents function definition.

func-def ::= 'FUNC' IDENTIFIER?
           | '(' ( IDENTIFIER (',' IDENTIFIER)* )? ')'
           | '->' expr

Includes:
    - Optional Function Name: Functions can have an optional name.
    - Arguments: Can have an argument list.
    - Function Body: Defined after ->.

-----------------------------------------
           Example Programs
-----------------------------------------
1. **Variable Assignment and Arithmetic Operations**
   VAR x = 5
   VAR y = x + 3
   VAR z = y * 2

2. **If-Else Conditional**
   IF x > 4 THEN y = 10
   ELIF x == 4 THEN y = 8
   ELSE y = 0

3. **Function Definition and Function Call**
   FUNC add(x, y) -> x + y
   VAR result = add(5, 3)
